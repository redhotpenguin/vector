# Soak Tests

This directory contains vector's soak tests, the integrated variant of our
benchmarks. The idea was first described in [RFC
6531](../rfcs/2021-02-23-6531-performance-testing.md) and has been steadily
improved as laid out in [Issue
9515](https://github.com/vectordotdev/vector/issues/9515).
